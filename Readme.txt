Please write a little chatbot in nodeJs that:
  You can ask for a Joke
  After you got at least one joke you can ask for more (not before)
  After 10 jokes it should tell you to wait 24h
  Also implement a reset and help functionality in a way that you see fit.
  The Chatbot can be either Web-, Console or FB Messenger based. (later is preferred)
Please donâ€™t use any externally hosted NLP providers)
Jokes can be received from this API: http://www.icndb.com/api/
