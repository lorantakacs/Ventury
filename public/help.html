    <h1>Help</h1>
    <p>I will show you some jokes in a chatwindow. <br>To start the chat, enter both your first and last name and sign in.<br> After that please type <strong>Hi</strong> to the text box at the bottom of the chatwindow and click <u>Send</u>.<p>
    <p>After receiving 10 jokes you have to wait 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      But there is a trick! Sign out and sign in as Chuck Norris (first name: Chuck, last name: Norris). You will be able to type in your username, and by clicking the <u>Reset</u> button your can clear your chat history, so you can ask for more jokes. Actually as Chuck Norris you can clear the chat history for anybody.</p>
    <h1>Have Fun!</h1>
